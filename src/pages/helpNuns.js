      Help Tibetan Nuns, Inc. is a non-profit organization that raises money for
      education, health, and building construction for nuns in the Himalayan
      region. Amy McCracken started Help Tibetan Nuns in 2011 after she visited
      Thrangu Kong Jo Sherab Ling, a nunnery in Eastern Tibet. This region was
      hit by an earthquake the year before, which killed around 2,700 people in
      the area.
